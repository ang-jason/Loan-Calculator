# Loan Calculator
Loan Calculator is a app-lite Python library providing analytics and amorization table for your mortgage computation (local context)

### This is an open-ended category.

##### Quick Calculator Software: You may tend to do some specific calculation again and again. As an example, it can be your financial calculator for investment or retirement savings. You can write a Python program to do these tasks.

## Setup (on Linux)
1. Clone the repository from Github. On your terminal or Git Bash
2. Create Virtual Environment (MacOS/Linux): From the root folder, i.e. `Loan-Calculator`, create virtual environment called `virtenv`.
3. A folder called `virtenv` will be created. Now, activate the virtual environment.
4. Install the necessary packages for this library
5. Run flask to spin up the setup
```
git clone https://github.com/ang-jason/Loan-Calculator
cd Loan-Calculator
python -m venv virtenv
source virtenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```

#### Dev Environment or Vocareum
The following will be displayed on screen:
```
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
Once it is running, you can open another tab in your browser and type the following url: https://myserver.vocareum.com/.

To stop the web app type `CTRL+C`.

If you are using your own computer, make sure to change the flag voc=False in the following line inside `/app/__init__.py`.
```
# set voc=False if you run on local computer
application.wsgi_app = PrefixMiddleware(application.wsgi_app, voc=False)
```

## Flask Website Usage
**1. Upon accessing the website, input the parameters of the loan.**

###### Example of a typcial loan offering:

>3.39%pa for period up to Year 1. 
>4.48%pa for period up to Year 5 (Year 2 - Year 5)
>5.30%pa for period from Year 6 onwards (Year 5 - Year 6 onwards)

Loan amount `440248`
Annual interest rate `1.39,1.48,2.3`
Term Periods `1,5,6`
Loan Tenor `30`

###### *When there is single(fixed) interest rate, term period will be ignored. Different interest rate as well as Term periods are separated by single commas (no spaces), no need for decimals-denomination and percentage.*

**2. Click Show Schedule**

## Code Usage
The design of this library orginated from a single interest rate throughout the loan tenor and expanding further with features of different interest rates of associated loan periods. Output schedule is using pandas dataframe suitable for time series manipulation.

*Computation were generally done with minimum rounding. Recouncilation were performed to rounding of monthly payment as it illustrate billing to your two decimal places and the diference were negligence.*

```python
# Begin by importing the LoanSchedule class
# for single interest rate(fixed)
from loan_schedule import LoanSchedule

# Create a simple loan
# THE_LOANAMOUNT=440248
# THE_RATE=1.39
# THE_TENOR=30

# initialse the instance of LoanSchedule
fixed_rate = LoanSchedule(THE_LOANAMOUNT, THE_RATE, THE_TENOR)

# returns of loan schedule table of dataframe
# with headers 'StartBalance','Payment', 'Principal', 'Interest', 'EndBalance'
fixed_rate.show_schedule()

# returns info on the monthly installments of the loan ($1,496.26)
fixed_rate.monthly_payment_computed()


# for 'package type' interest rates & period terms
# distinction: this module is meant for multiple rates & terms
from loan_schedule_multiple import LoanScheduleMultiple

# typical package: 1.39%pa for period up to Year 1.
#                  1.48%pa for period up to Year 5 (Year 2 - Year 5)
#                  2.30%pa for period from Year 6 onwards (Year 5 - Year 6 onwards)
#                  
# THE_LOANAMOUNT=440248
# THE_RATE=[1.39,1.48,2.3]
# THE_TERM=[1,5,6]
# THE_TENOR=30


# initialse the instance of LoanScheduleMultiple
package_rate = LoanScheduleMultiple(THE_LOANAMOUNT, THE_RATE, THE_TERM, THE_TENOR)

# returns of loan schedule table of dataframe
# with headers 'StartBalance','Payment', 'Principal', 'Interest', 'EndBalance'
package_rate.show_schedule()

```

After generating the `show_schedule()` dataframe, we make use of `AnalyseSchedule` module to provide further analytics.

```python
# importing the class definition
from analyse_schedule import AnalyseSchedule

# loan schedule x into AnalyseSchedule class for further summary generation
summary = AnalyseSchedule(x)

# this function is for the summary of the loan
# returns total payments, principal, interest of the entire loan
total_payment, total_principal, total_interest = summary.total_ppi()


# this function is analysis of how much interst vs the principal amount
# returns ratio in percentage
ratio = summary.interest_to_principal()

# this function is analysis of how much payment vs the loan amount
# returns ratio in percentage
ratio = summary.payment_to_loan()


# this function is to return specific row (period_row) of the dataframe's schedule
# input based on months less 1 due to starting 0.
# e.g Year 2 = 2*12 = 24 -1 = 23th row
year2_row = summary.show_schedule_row(2*12-1)


# this function to return the quick view of monthly payment and the number of times the payments to be made
mthly_payments, mthly_period = summary.show_payments_brief()

# this function is to analytical table top summary of the loan
# returns the format should be as shown below (dictionary type)
# Your Table Top Summary of the Loan
# Total interest payable: XXX
# Total principal: XXX
# Total payable: XXX
#
# Total payments to loan ratio: XXX
# Associated monthly payments: XXX
#
# Principal Balance after Year 2: XXX
# Principal Balance after Year 3: XXX
# Principal Balance after Year 5: XXX
quick_summary = summary.loan_tabletop_brief()


# to return individual colums of list of yearly rows to pipe into chartjs
# provide graphical analytics using chartjs by pulling each data columns set
yearly_labels, data_col_names, data_sbalance, data_payment, \
 data_principal, data_interest = summary.show_yearly_brief()

```

## Under the hood
InterestRateMarket class was created with future flexible of market conventions. Some financial instituation may differ from market convention.

*E.g if the interest rate is 1.39% pa. The monthly rate will be 1.39%/12(months).*

There is a possible that the computation could be divided by 360/365 (days) and multiple by calendar days in month or 30.

```python    
def __init__(self, given_annual_rate, year_length=12, month_length=0):
    self.given_annual_rate = given_annual_rate/100.0
    self.year_length = year_length
    self.month_length = month_length

```



## Future Features or Improvements
- [ ] improve UI
- [ ] consideration of js implementation
- [ ] resolve corner cases
- [ ] add accordion for yearly row

## Vocareum Troubleshooting
```
You are using pip version 10.0.1, however version 21.2.4 is available.       
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command. 
```
Consider updating pip first before `pip install -r requirements.txt`

`pip install --upgrade pip`
